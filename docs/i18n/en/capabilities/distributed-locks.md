# Distributed Locks

Distributed lock support has a framework-neutral contract: `DistributedLockClient`, `LockTemplate`,
`LockOptions`, and `@DistributedLock`. Use a lock only when mutual exclusion is part of the use-case
semantics; it does not replace database consistency or aggregate invariants.

Programmatic usage:

```java
lockTemplate.execute(
        "order:" + command.orderId(),
        LockOptions.builder()
                .waitTime(Duration.ofSeconds(2))
                .leaseTime(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
                .build(),
        () -> {
            applicationService.confirm(command);
            return null;
        });
```

The key identifies the protected business resource. Use a stable key that makes independent work
concurrent and conflicting work mutually exclusive.

`waitTime` controls how long a caller may wait to acquire the lock. `leaseTime` controls the lock
lifetime when the selected lock client supports an explicit lease.

When the lock cannot be acquired, the default `LockFailureMode.THROW` raises
`DistributedLockUnavailableException`. Use `failureMode = LockFailureMode.SKIP` only when skipping
the method is an intentional business outcome.

## Ordering With Transactions

When a use case needs both a distributed lock and a transaction, acquire the lock first and call
`TransactionRunner` inside its critical section. This avoids opening a database transaction while
waiting for a distributed lock.

For Spring Boot runtime assembly, selected lock-client integration, user overrides, and annotation
configuration, see [Spring Boot Runtime Assembly](../implementations/spring-boot.md). The exact
starter, property, and auto-configuration conditions are in the
[Spring Boot Auto-configuration reference](../reference/spring-boot-autoconfiguration.md).
