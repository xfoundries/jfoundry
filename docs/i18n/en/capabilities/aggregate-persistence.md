# Aggregate Persistence

Aggregate persistence preserves the aggregate boundary while allowing a business project to choose
its persistence technology. The domain model is not a persistence schema: annotations, type
handlers, logical-delete fields, and generated identifiers stay outside the aggregate.

## Contract

`DataMapper` is the explicit boundary between an aggregate and its persistence representation. It
owns ID conversion, aggregate restoration, and the mapping of the aggregate's current state. A
mapper can be plain Java, MapStruct-generated where that is sufficient, or a dependency-injected
component when the application needs it.

The persistence adapter owns the complete aggregate operation. It must not offer a generic
multi-table collection synchronization policy: replacement, differential updates, append-only
writes, cascades, and deletion order are business decisions. A business adapter owns dependent-row
synchronization and uses a project-specific atomic deletion strategy when database constraints need
it.

## Transaction And Failure Semantics

`AggregatePersistenceContext` tracks persistence-owned state for one runtime-managed transaction.
Tracked operations fail fast when called outside that transaction or for an aggregate not loaded in
it. Detached aggregate merge is not a supported lifecycle.

`PersistenceFailureTranslator` is a runtime-neutral SPI. A runtime integration may translate
known availability failures to `ExternalAccessException`; integrity, locking, SQL, mapper, and
unknown failures retain their original meaning unless a business adapter can identify a genuine
business conflict.
