# Getting Started

Start with the smallest architecture that serves the current business use case. jfoundry is most
useful when a system needs explicit aggregates, invariants, domain events, architecture boundaries,
or reliable external integration. A short CRUD prototype without those needs may be simpler with a
plain runtime framework and ORM.

## Choose A BOM And Module Boundary

Import `jfoundry-dependencies` for a runtime-neutral application,
`jfoundry-spring-dependencies` when Spring Boot assembles the application, or
`jfoundry-quarkus-dependencies` for the available Quarkus transaction integration. Select the
version from the intended release line; this project currently uses the following development version:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.github.xfoundries</groupId>
            <artifactId>jfoundry-spring-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

Keep dependencies in the layer that owns them:

| Module | Starting dependency |
|--------|---------------------|
| Domain | `jfoundry-domain-starter` |
| Application | `jfoundry-application-starter` |
| Infrastructure | The selected technology's infrastructure starter, such as `jfoundry-infrastructure-mybatis-plus-starter` |
| Spring Boot assembly | `jfoundry-spring-boot-starter` plus only the required runtime capability starters |
| Quarkus transaction integration | `jfoundry-quarkus-runtime` |

Choose Hexagonal or Onion from domain and project constraints; jfoundry does not select an
architecture style for a business project. Add ArchUnit tests before implementation grows around
accidental dependencies.

## Assemble A Minimal Spring Boot Runtime

For a Spring Boot application using business MyBatis-Plus persistence, the runtime module starts
with the base and MyBatis-Plus runtime starters:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.github.xfoundries</groupId>
        <artifactId>jfoundry-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.github.xfoundries</groupId>
        <artifactId>jfoundry-mybatis-plus-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Configure the application's datasource and keep its persistence adapter in the infrastructure
module. The MyBatis-Plus runtime starter does not add Outbox or Inbox stores. For a JPA runtime,
replace the MyBatis-Plus runtime starter with `jfoundry-jpa-spring-boot-starter`; it also leaves
Outbox and Inbox stores explicit. See [MyBatis-Plus](../implementations/mybatis-plus.md),
[JPA](../implementations/jpa.md), and [Spring Boot Runtime Assembly](../implementations/spring-boot.md)
for the exact implementation boundaries.

## Add Capabilities Only When Needed

- Add [Application Transactions](../capabilities/application-transactions.md) or
  [Distributed Locks](../capabilities/distributed-locks.md) when the use case needs them.
- Add [Reliable Messaging: Outbox And Inbox](../capabilities/reliable-messaging.md) only for
  cross-process delivery or consumer idempotency; select its store explicitly.
- Add messaging, broker, Web MVC, and scheduling starters only for their corresponding capability.

The [Spring Boot Auto-configuration reference](../reference/spring-boot-autoconfiguration.md) is
the canonical catalog for individual starters, properties, and registration conditions.

For Quarkus dependency setup, transaction propagation, application-service domain-event dispatch,
and Native Image verification, see [Quarkus Runtime Integration](../implementations/quarkus.md).

## Reading Path

1. Define boundaries with [Architecture Styles](../framework/architecture-styles.md) and
   [ArchUnit Architecture Rules](../framework/archunit-rules.md).
2. Model aggregates and choose repository/read-side contracts with
   [Repository and Read-side Contracts](../modeling/repository-vs-read-contracts.md).
3. Apply [Aggregate Persistence](../capabilities/aggregate-persistence.md) through the selected
   implementation.

See [Adoption Readiness and Validated Scope](adoption-readiness.md) before relying on a capability
in production.
