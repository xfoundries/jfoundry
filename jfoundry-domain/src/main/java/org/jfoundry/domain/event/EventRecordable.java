/// boundary. The application layer extracts and dispatches them at use-case
/// boundaries. This interface is decoupled from the jMolecules AggregateRoot
/// marker; the framework owns the event API and {@code BaseAggregateRoot}
/// implements it.

    /// model, the caller reads the current events and clears the same events in
    /// one method call. It does not imply any concurrency or thread-safety
    /// guarantee. After this method returns, the instance no longer retains the
    /// returned events. An empty list is returned when no events are pending.
