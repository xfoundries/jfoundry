/// Repository interface for aggregate roots.
/// <p>
/// A repository models a conceptual set of aggregate roots and persists their
/// lifecycle:
/// - findById: load one aggregate root by id
/// - add: add a new aggregate to the set, usually an SQL insert
/// - modify: update an existing aggregate in the set, usually an SQL update
/// - addAll / modifyAll: batch variants
/// - remove: remove an aggregate from the set, usually an SQL delete
/// <p>
/// Collection semantics:
/// - Business method names and call context naturally decide whether an
///   aggregate is new or existing; callers choose {@code add} or {@code modify}
///   explicitly, and the repository does not infer that decision.
/// - MyBatis has no persistence context / Unit of Work and cannot perform JPA
///   style dirty checking, so {@code modify} must be called explicitly.
/// <p>
/// Design constraints:
/// - Repositories are only for aggregate roots.
/// - One transaction should modify one aggregate root by default.
/// - Read models, statistics, pagination, and maintenance cleanup should be
///   exposed through named business boundaries, not generic repository criteria.
///
/// @param <T> aggregate root type
/// @param <ID> identifier type
